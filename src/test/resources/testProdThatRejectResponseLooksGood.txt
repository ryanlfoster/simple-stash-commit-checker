  Dont mention that you are fixing a review, say what you are changing and why it needs to be changed!: .*review.*

- Every commit needs at least one issue. If this is just refactoring or other code cleanup, you can use JIRA AB-1234.
  JIRA: ((?<!([A-Z]{1,10})-?)[A-Z]+-\d+)
  Incident: INC[0-9]*

- It is easier to maintain the code if you create a JIRA issue for every incident. But this is optional for now.
